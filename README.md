## Description

This is the Second weekly challenge for the my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a basic portfolio to show what I can do. What was made was a basic skeleton of a portfolio and implementing the things learnt in the bootcamp thus far. 

In this page I have not only included techniques such as anchor links and flex boxes but also self taught techniques such as creating a rotating spinning cube.

I intend to consistently go back to this page and implement the new things I learn each week to further build my portfolio, by the end of I want to make my cube interactive and to be able to throw it across the page with Javascript.
