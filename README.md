# <My Portfolio> ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TheIPM/My-Portfolio?style=plastic) ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/TheIPM)


## Description

This is the Second weekly challenge for the my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a basic portfolio to show what I can do. What was made was a basic skeleton of a portfolio and implementing the things learnt in the bootcamp thus far. 

In this page I have not only included techniques such as anchor links and flex boxes but also self taught techniques such as creating a rotating spinning cube.

I intend to consistently go back to this page and implement the new things I learn each week to further build my portfolio, by the end of I want to make my cube interactive and to be able to throw it across the page with Javascript.

When viewing this portfolio you can interact with the navigation bar on the top right to take you to different sections of the page. When on the projects page you can click on the image that says horiseon, to be taken to that page. If you resize the page the images rearrange themselves to have 2 on each row. Finally you can also click on my logo to be taken to my github page
